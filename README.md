Program Summary:

The Java program manages a simulated fantasy football league season, incorporating regular season and playoff phases. 
It handles tasks such as generating weekly matchups, tracking team scores, determining winners and losers, and displaying league standings. 
The program utilizes object-oriented programming principles, including classes and methods, along with various Java language features such as loops, 
conditional statements, collections, random number generation, exception handling, string manipulation, regular expressions, and output formatting.

Java Knowledge Utilized:

Object-Oriented Programming: Classes represent entities like teams, players, and schedule. Methods encapsulate functionality for generating matchups, printing standings, etc.
Loops: Utilized for iterating over weeks, teams, and players.
Conditional Statements: Used for menu choices, determining winners/losers, and setting score ranges.
Collections: ArrayList stores team rankings, winners, and losers. HashMap stores team names and corresponding wins/scores.
Random Number Generation: Math.random() generates random scores based on player rankings.
Exception Handling: try-catch blocks handle interruptions in program execution (e.g., Thread.sleep()).
String Manipulation: Extracts team names and numbers from strings.
Regular Expressions: Used to extract numeric values from strings, e.g., team numbers.
Formatting Output: printf method formats output for structured presentation, e.g., league standings.
